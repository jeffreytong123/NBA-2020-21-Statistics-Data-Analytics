The 2020-2021 NBA season was unlike any other in recent history. It was marked by the global COVID-19 pandemic that caused the league to delay the start of the season and implement extensive health and safety protocols to protect players and staff. The season began on December 22, 2020, with a shortened 72-game schedule, and featured a unique play-in tournament to determine the final playoff spots. The season also saw the return of several key players from injury, such as Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, and the emergence of new stars like Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the league successfully completed the season and crowned a new champion in the Milwaukee Bucks.
