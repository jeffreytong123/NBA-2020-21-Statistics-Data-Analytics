NBA 2020-21 Season Statistics Data Analytics using PostgreSQL

I pulled the data of the 2020-21 NBA regular and postseason games from ESPN's website and copied the data into a CSV file so that I could easily input the data into a database using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin4

This project comprises of two tables: one for NBA regular season games and the other for NBA post-season games. Although the NBA play-in tournament was introduced this season, with only 8 games in total, I deemed it irrelevant to create an additional table for it as I don't anticipate requiring its data for this project.


All the data that is obtained is found through ESPN
