NBA 2020-21 Season Statistics Data Analytics using PostgreSQL

I pulled the data of the 2020-21 NBA regular and postseason games from ESPN's website and copied the data into a CSV file so that I could easily input the data into a database using PostgreSQL




All the data that is obtained is found through ESPN
